    def to_simple_rst_tree(self, multinuclear, strategy='id'):
        r"""
        Given a dependency tree and a collection of relation labels,
        to be interpreted as being multinuclear, return a 'SimpleRSTTree'.
        Note that nodes are ordered by text span, so that `e1 -R-> e2` and
        `e2 -R-> e1` would both be interpreted as `R(e1, e2)`, the
        potential difference being which is treated as the nucleus and as
        the satellite.

        The conversion algorithm can be seen a two-pass descent/conversion,
        ascent/assembly one. First, we go down the dependency tree,
        annotating each node with a trivial RST tree (ie. a leaf node).
        Then, we walk back up the dependency tree, connecting RST treelets
        together, gradually replacing nodes with increasingly larger RST
        trees.

        The first tricky part of this conversion is to keep in mind
        that the conversion process involves some rotation, namely
        that this dependency structure ::

               R
            a ---> b

        (if we gloss over nuclearity and node order details) is rotated
        into something that looks like this ::


            R +-> a                                 R
              |          (or more conventionally,  / \ )
              +-> b                               a   b


        Where things get tricky is if a node in the dependency tree
        points has multiple children ::

                r1
            src +--> tgt1
                |
                |r2
                +--> tgt2
                |
                ..
                |
                |rN
                +--> tgtN


        In that case, having pivoted the `src(r1:tgt1)` link into something
        like `r1(src, tgt)`, it may not be so clear how to deal with
        subsequents targets `tgt2..tgtN`. We want to both reflect that `src`
        has a dependency link with all of these targets at the same time
        even though it's stuck as an RST child node. The trick is to see the
        process as more of a fold than a map. Keeping in mind that `src`,
        `tgt1..tgtN` are all RST treelets (`tgt1..tgtN` having been built up
        from recursive descent), the idea is to gradually replace the src
        node with an increasingly nested RST tree as we go along ::


            +----------+
            |   r1     |    r2
            |  /  \    + -+---> tgt2
            | src tgt1 |  |
            +----------+  | r3
                          +---> tgt3
                          |
                          ..
                          | rN

            |    /  \    |
            |   r1  tgt2 |    r3
            |  /  \      + -+---> tgt3

            of children but *stably* sorted to fulfill an inside-out
            traversal on either side.

            Let's back up a little bit for some background on this criterion.
            We assume that dependency tree nodes can be characterised and
            ordered by their position in the text. If we did such a thing, the
            head node would sit somewhere between its children ::

                lX, .., l2, l1, h, r1, r2, .., rY

            An inside-out traversal is one in which moves strictly outward
            from the centre node. Note that this does not imply any other
            requirement on the order our traversal (particularly on left vs
            right), so `h l1 l2 .. lX r1 r2, etc` is as much a valid
            inside-outside traversal as `h l1 r1 l2 etc`; however,
            `h l2 l1 etc` is right out.

            The following strategies are currently implemented:
            - 'lllrrr': all left then right dependents,
            - 'rrrlll': all right then left dependents,
            - 'id': stable sort that keeps the original interleaving,
            as defined below.

            TRICKY SORTING! The current implementation of the 'id' strategy was
            reached through a bit of trial and error, so you may want to modify
            with caution.

            Most of the trickiness in the 'id' strategy is in making this a
            *stable* sort, ie. we want to preserve the original order of
            the targets as much as possible because this allows us to have
            round trip conversions from RST to DT and back. This essentially
            means preserving the interleaving of left/right nodes. The basic
            logic in the implementation is to traverse our target list as
            a series of LEFT or RIGHT slots, filling the slots in an
            inside-out order. So for example, if we saw a target list
            `l3 r1 r3 l2 l1 r2`, we would treat it as the slots `L R R L L R`
            and fill them out as `l1 r1 r2 l2 l3 r3`
