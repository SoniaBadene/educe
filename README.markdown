## About

Abstract representation of a discourse-annotated corpus.

Currently, this library is geared towards the needs of the [STAC
research project][stac].  In particular, it assumes

- Settlers of Catan non-cooperative conversation domain
- Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT)
- [Glozz annotation platform][glozz]

But we are keeping sight of the longer term objectives of generalising
it to at least a wider range of domains
