Educe
=====

`Educe <http://kowey.github.io/educe>`__ is a library for working with a
variety of discourse corpora. This tutorial aims to show what using
educe would be like when working with the `Penn Discourse
Treebank <http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~pdtb/>`__ corpus.

Installation
------------

.. code:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/kowey/educe.git
    cd educe
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: these instructions assume you are running within a `virtual
environment <http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__. If not,
and if you have permission denied errors, replace ``pip`` with
``sudo pip``.

Tutorial setup
--------------

This tutorial require that you have a local copy of the PDTB. For
purposes of this tutorial, you will need to link this into the data
directory, for example

::

    ln -s $HOME/CORPORA/pdtb_v2 data

Optionnally, to match the pdtb text spans to their analysis in the Penn
Treebank, you need to have a local copy of the PTB at the same location

::

    ln -s $HOME/CORPORA/PTBIII data

Tutorial in browser (optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial can either be followed along with the command line and
your favourite text editor, or embedded in an interactive webpage via
iPython:

.. code:: shell

    pip install ipython
    cd tutorials
    ipython notebook

.. code:: python

    # some helper functions for the tutorial below
    
    def show_type(rel):
        "short string for a relation type"
        return type(rel).__name__[:-8]  # remove "Relation"
    
    def highlight(astring, color=1):
        "coloured text"
        return("\x1b[3{color}m{str}\x1b[0m".format(color=color, str=astring))

Reading corpus files (PDTB)
---------------------------

NB: unfortunately, at the time of this writing, PDTB support in educe is
very much behind and rather inconsistent with that of the other corpora.
Apologies for the mess!

.. code:: python

    from __future__ import print_function
    import educe.pdtb
    
    # relative to the educe docs directory
    data_dir = '../data'
    corpus_dir = '{dd}/pdtb_v2/data'.format(dd=data_dir)
    
    # read a small sample of the pdtb
    reader = educe.pdtb.Reader(corpus_dir)
    anno_files = reader.filter(reader.files(),
                               lambda k: k.doc.startswith('wsj_231'))
    corpus = reader.slurp(anno_files, verbose=True)
        
    # print the first five rel types we read from each doc
    for key in corpus.keys()[:10]:
        doc = corpus[key]
        rtypes = [show_type(r) for r in doc]
        print("[{0}] {1}".format(key.doc, " ".join(rtypes[:5])))

What's a corpus?
----------------

A corpus is a dictionary from ``FileId`` keys to representation of PDTB
documents.

Keys
~~~~

A key has several fields meant to distinguish different annotated
documents from each other. In the case of the PDTB, the only field of
interest is ``doc``, a Wall Street journal article number as you might
find in the PTB.

.. code:: python

    ex_key = educe.pdtb.mk_key('wsj_2314')
    ex_doc = corpus[ex_key]
    
    print(ex_key)
    print(ex_key.__dict__)


.. parsed-literal::

    wsj_2314 [None] discourse unknown
    {'doc': 'wsj_2314', 'subdoc': None, 'annotator': 'unknown', 'stage': 'discourse'}


Documents
~~~~~~~~~

At some point in the future, the representation of a document may change
to something a bit higher level and easier to work with. For now, a
‚Äúdocument‚Äù in the educe PDTB sense consists of a list of relations, each
relation having a low-level representation that hews fairly closely to
the grammar described in the PDTB annotation manual.

**TIP**: At least until educe grows a more educe-like uniform
representation of PDTB annotations, a very useful resource to look at
when working with the PDTB may be The Penn Discourse Treebank 2.0
Annotation Manual, sections 6.3.1 to 6.3.5 (Description of PDTB
representation format ‚Üí File format ‚Üí General outline‚Ä¶).

.. code:: python

    lr = [r for r in ex_doc]
    r0 = lr[0]
    type(r0).__name__




.. parsed-literal::

    'ExplicitRelation'



Relations
~~~~~~~~~

There are five types of relation annotation: explicit, implicit, altlex,
entity, no (as in no relation). These are described in further detail in
the PDTB annotation manual. Here's well try to sketch out some of the
important properties.

The main thing to notice is that the 5 types of annotation not have very
much in common with each other, but they have many overlapping pieces
(see table in the `educe.pdtb
docs <https://educe.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api-doc/educe.pdtb.html>`__)

-  a relation instance always has two arguments (these can be selected
   as ``arg1`` and ``arg2``)

.. code:: python

    def display_rel(r):
        "pretty print a relation instance"
    
        rtype = show_type(r)
        
        if rtype == "Explicit":
            conn = highlight(r.connhead)
        elif rtype == "Implicit":
            conn = "{rtype} {conn1}".format(rtype=rtype,
                                            conn1=highlight(str(r.connective1)))
        elif rtype == "AltLex":
            conn = "{rtype} {sem1}".format(rtype=rtype,
                                           sem1=highlight(r.semclass1))
        else:
            conn = rtype
    
        fmt = "{src}\n \t ---[{label}]---->\n \t\t\t{tgt}"
        return(fmt.format(src=highlight(r.arg1.text, 2),
                          label=conn,
                          tgt=highlight(r.arg2.text, 2)))
            
    
    print(display_rel(r0))
